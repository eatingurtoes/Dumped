# Dumped
Save blobs without a jailbreak on A6 devices!
Dumped is a program to dump onboard .shsh blobs from A6 devices without a jailbreak, straight from DFU mode.
How to use: 
1. Plug your device into your computer and enter DFU mode.
2. Execute pwn.sh.
3. Execute ./bootpwned.sh. You will need to specify your device's identifier as an argument. If I had an iPhone 5,2, I would run "./bootpwned.sh iPhone5,2."
4. Place the .ipsw of the version you wish to dump blobs from in the Dumped folder, and rename it to "ipsw.ipsw."
5. Your blobs should be dumped! If anything goes wrong, feel free to create a GitHub issue, or reach out to me on Reddit (u/eatingurtoes), Discord (@frog (he/him)#6816).
